# ✨ Awesome Panel Examples

A repository of awesome Panel data app examples.

The source files are available in the [src](/src) folder.

The apps are converted to webassembly and released to
[awesome-panel.github.io/examples/](https://awesome-panel.github.io/examples/) as simple as

1. `$ panel convert app.py` (1 second)
2. `$ git push` (1 second)

This is **THE FASTEST WAY TO DEPLOY DATA APPS** in Python.

The apps are **very performant** when loaded because there is no latency for communication between
server and client.

BUT the apps **take time to load** as they need to download a Python runtime and additional packages
(50MB per app).

This is **THE FUTURE OF DATAVIZ** in Python.
